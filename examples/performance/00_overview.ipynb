    "# Performance optimization overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this tutorial is twofold\n",
    "\n",
    "* Illustrate the performance optimizations applied to the code generated by an `Operator`.\n",
    "* Describe the options Devito provides to users to steer the optimization process.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we shall see, most optimizations are automatically applied as they're known to systematically improve performance. Others, whose impact varies across different `Operator`'s, are instead to be enabled through specific flags.\n",
    "\n",
    "An Operator has several preset **optimization levels**; the fundamental ones are `noop` and `advanced`. With `noop`, no performance optimizations are introduced. With `advanced`, several flop-reducing and data locality optimization passes are applied. Examples of flop-reducing optimization passes are common sub-expressions elimination and factorization, while examples of data locality optimization passes are loop fusion and cache blocking. Optimization levels in Devito are conceptually akin to the `-O2, -O3, ...` flags in classic C/C++/Fortran compilers.\n",
    "\n",
    "An optimization pass may provide knobs, or **options**, for fine-grained tuning. As explained in the next sections, some of these options are given at compile-time, others at run-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**\\*\\* Remark \\*\\***\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallelism -- both shared-memory (e.g., OpenMP) and distributed-memory (MPI) -- is _by default disabled_ and is _not_ controlled via the optimization level. In this tutorial we will also show how to enable OpenMP parallelism (you'll see it's trivial!). Another mini-guide about parallelism in Devito and related aspects is available [here](https://github.com/devitocodes/devito/tree/master/benchmarks/user#a-step-back-configuring-your-machine-for-reliable-benchmarking). \n",
