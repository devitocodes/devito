    "# Performance optimization overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial illustrates the performance optimizations applied to the code generated by an `Operator`. As we shall see, most optimizations are automatically applied as they're known to systematically improve performance. Others, whose impact varies across different `Operator`s, are instead to be enabled through specific options.\n",
    "\n",
    "An Operator has several preset **optimization levels**; the fundamental ones are `noop` and `advanced`. With `noop`, no performance optimizations are introduced by the compiler. With `advanced`, several flop-reducing and data locality _optimization passes_ are performed. Examples of flop-reducing optimization passes are common sub-expressions elimination and factorization; examples of data locality optimization passes are loop fusion and cache blocking. SIMD vectorization, via compiler auto-vectorization, is enforced through OpenMP pragmas.\n",
    "\n",
    "An optimization pass may provide knobs, or **options**, for fine-grained tuning. As explained in the next sections, some of these options are given at compile-time, others at run-time.\n",

This might seem odd at first -- why should the `u.dy.dy` temporary, that is `r6`, now be a three-dimensional temporary when we know already it could be a two-dimensional temporary? This is merely a compiler heuristic: by adding an extra dimension to `r6`, both temporary can be scheduled within the same loop nest, thus augmenting data reuse and potentially enabling further cross-expression optimizations. We can however tell the compiler not to use this heuristic through the `min-storage` option."
