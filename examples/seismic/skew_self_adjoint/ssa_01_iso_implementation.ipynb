    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to generate and prove correctness of modeling and inversion capability in Devito for variable density visco- acoustics using an energy conserving form of the wave equation. We will use a simple form of dissipation only Q attenuation that allows unifying modeling physics in the interior and the absorbing boundary region. We also describe how the linearization of an energy conserving *skew self adjoint* system with respect to modeling parameters allows using the same modeling system for both forward and adjoint evolutions. This notebook is the first in a series, continuing with VTI and TTI anisotropic systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "We begin with the *skew self adjoint* form of the variable density scalar acoustic wave equation with dissipation only Q. The dissipation only (no dispersion) attenuation term used below $\\left (\\frac{\\displaystyle \\omega}{Q} \\frac{\\displaystyle \\partial}{\\displaystyle \\partial t} P \\right)$ is an approximation of a [Maxwell Body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_material) -- that is to say viscoelasticity approximated with a spring and dashpot in series. In practice this approach for attentuating outgoing waves is very similar to the Cernan style damping in absorbing boundaries used elsewhere in Devito (**needs link**). \n",
    "\n",
    "The derivation of the attenuation model is not in scope for this tutorial, but one important point is that the physics in the absorbing boundary region and the interior of the model are *unified*, allowing the same modeling equations to be used everwhere, with physical Q values in the interior tapering to small Q at the boundaries to attentuate outgoing waves.
