    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to prototype the compression/serialization and de-serialization/de-compression for wavefields in Devito. The motivation is using seismic modeling operators for full waveform inversion (FWI). Some of the steps in FWI require the use of previously computed wavefields, and of particular interest the adjoint of the Jacobian linearized operator -- an operator that maps data perturbation into velocity perturbation and is used to build FWI gradients -- requires a zero-lag temporal correlation with the wavefield that is computed with the nonlinear source. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are implemented alternatives to serialization/de-serialization like checkpointing, but we investigate the serialization option here. For more information on checkpointing, please see the details for ```pyrevolve```, a python implementation of `optimal checkpointing` for Devito (https://github.com/devitocodes/pyrevolve).\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to provide a *proof of concept* for compression/serialization and de-serialization/de-compression of the nonlinear wavefield. We will achieve this via _time blocking_: we will run a number of time steps in the generated c kernel, and then return control to Python for compression/serialization (for the nonlinear forward operator), and de-serialization/de-compression (for the linearized Jacobian forward and adjoint operators).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to illustrate the use case for serialization, we outline the workflow for computing the gradient of the FWI objective function, ignoring a lot of details, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate the nonlinear forward modeled data at the receivers $d_{mod}$\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "d_{mod} = F m \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compress and serialize the nonlinear source wavefield to disk in *time blocks* during computation of 1. The entire nonlinear wavefield is of size $[nt,nx,nz]$ in 2D, but we deal with a block of $M$ time steps at a time, so the size of the chunk to be compressed and serialized is $[M,nx,nz]$. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute the data residual $\\delta r$ by differencing observed and modeled data at the receivers \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\delta r = d_{obs} - d_{mod}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Backproject the data residual $\\delta r$ via time reversal with the adjoint linearized Jacobian operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. De-serialize and de-compress the nonlinear source wavefield from disk during computation in step 4, synchronizing time step between the nonlinear wavefield computed forward in time, and time reversed adjoint wavefield. We will deal with de-serialization and de-compression of chunks of $M$ time steps of size $[M,nx,nz]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Increment the model perturbation via zero lag correlation of the de-serialized nonlinear source wavefield and the backprojected receiver adjoint wavefield. Note that this computed model perturbation is the  _gradient_ of the FWI objective function.\n",

    "## Description of time blocking implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "We gratefully acknowledge Downunder Geosolutions (DUG) for in depth discussions about their production time blocking implementation. Those discussions shaped the implementation shown here. The most important idea is to separate the programmatic containers used for propagation and serialization. To do this we utilize two distinct ```TimeFunction```'s.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Propagation uses ```TimeFunction(..., save=None)```\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a default constructed ```TimeFunction``` for propagation. This can be specified in the constructor via either ```save=None``` or no ```save``` argument at all. Devito backs such a default ```TimeFunction``` by a ```Buffer``` of size ```time_order+1```, or 3 for second order in time. We show below the mapping from the monotonic *ordinary time indices* to the buffered *modulo time indices* as used by a ```Buffer``` in a ```TimeFuntion``` with ```time_order=2```.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modulo indexing for ```Buffer``` of size 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "Ordinary time indices:  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15\n",
    "Modulo   time indices:  0  1  2  0  1  2  0  1  2  0  1  2  0  1  2  0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Important note:* the modulo indexing of ```Buffer``` is the reason we will separate propagation from serialization. If we use a larger ```Bufffer``` as the ```TimeFunction``` for propagation, we would have to deal with the modulo indexing not just for the current time index, but also previous and next time indices (assuming second order in time). This means that the previous and next time steps can overwrite the locations of the ordinary time indices when you propagate for a block of time steps. **This is the reason we do not use the same ```TimeFunction``` for both propagation and serialization.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generated code for a second order in time PDE\n",
    "We now show an excerpt from Devito generated code for a second order in time operator. A second order in time PDE requires two wavefields in order to advance in time: the wavefield at the next time step $u(t+\\Delta t)$ is a function of the wavefield at previous time step $u(t-\\Delta t)$ and the wavefield at the current time step $u(t)$. Remember that Devito uses a ```Buffer``` of size 3 to handle this. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the generated code there are three modulo time indices that are a function of ordinary time and cycle through the values $[0,1,2]$:\n",
    "* ```t0``` -- current time step\n",
    "* ```t1``` -- next time step\n",
    "* ```t2``` -- previous time step\n",
    "\n",
    "We show an excerpt at the beginning of the time loop from the generated code below, with ordinary time loop index ```time```. Note that we have simplified the generated code by breaking a single for loop specification line into multiple lines for clarity. We have also added comments to help understand the mapping from ordinary to modulo time indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for (int time = time_m; time <= time_M; time += 1) {\n",
    "  t0 = (time + 0)%(3);    // time index for the current time step \n",
    "  t1 = (time + 1)%(3);    // time index for the next time step\n",
    "  t2 = (time + 2)%(3);    // time index for the  previous time step\n",
    "  \n",
    "  // ... PIE: propagation, source injection, receiver extraction ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be obvious that using a single container for both propagation and serialization is problematic because the loop runs over ordinary time indices ```time_m``` through ```time_M```, but will access stored previous time step wavefields at indices ```time_m-1``` through ```time_M-1``` and store computed next time step wavefields in indices ```time_m+1``` through ```time_M+1```. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Serialization uses ```TimeFunction(..., save=Buffer(M))``` \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use an independent second ```Buffer``` of size $M$ for serialization in our time blocking implementation. This second ```TimeFunction``` will also use modulo indexing, but by design we only access indices ```time_m``` through ```time_M``` in each time block. This means we do not need to worry about wrapping indices from previous time step or next time step wavefields.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Minimum and maximum allowed time index for second order PDE\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that for a second order in time system the minimum allowed time index ```time_m``` will be $1$, because time index $0$ would imply that the previous time step wavefield $u(t-\\Delta t)$ exists at time index $-1$, and $0$ is the minimum array location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the maximum allowed time index ```time_M``` will be $nt-2$, because time index $nt-1$ would imply that the next time step wavefield $u(t+\\Delta t)$ exists at time index $nt$, and $nt-1$ is the maximum array location.\n",
