    "# The Devito compiler\n",
    "\n",
    "In Devito, an `Operator` carries out three fundamental tasks: generation of low-level code, JIT compilation, and execution. Overall, the lowering process performed by an `Operator` – from high-level equations to dynamically compiled and executable code – consists of multiple compiler passes, summarized in the Figure bellow. The following series of notebooks will describe these compilation passes in a hands-on fashion. We will explore the heart of the `Operator` class, which orchestrates code generation and compilation. For more details, see the [Operator class](https://github.com/devitocodes/devito/blob/master/devito/operator/operator.py).\n",

    "The reader of this series of tutorials is expected to be familiar with the basic Devito API (i.e., `Grid`, `Function`/`TimeFunction`, `Operator`, ...). Otherwise, the CFD tutorials in `examples/cfd` are a better place to start.\n",

    "Many of the examples and exercises shown here are extracted from test cases found in the folder `devito/tests`, or from the documentation itself.\n",
