Most implicit methods require solving an equation iteratively, when an approximated solution is made better and better after each iteration."

    "### Breaking Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "One example of an iterative method is the Newton-Raphson method, which is a root-finding algorithm that can be used, for example, to find the square root of a number $N$ with arbitrary precision. The equation $f(x) = x^2 - N$ has two real roots, namely $\\sqrt{N}$ and $-\\sqrt{N}$. Given an initial approximation $x_0 \\approx N$, the Newton method gives a better approximation by the equation $x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}$. One way of knowing when to stop iterating is to use the following stopping criteria $|x_{n+1} - x_n| < \\epsilon$, with $\\epsilon$ being a sufficiently small value. This criteria is not sufficient to guarantee the current approximation is inside an interval of size $\\epsilon$ around the real solution, but is enough for our purposes."

A residual variable is created to store a value that should represent how far from the solution the method is.\n",

    "Also, the devito class used to break loops is called __ConditionalDimension__. It gives devito a necessary condition when executing an equation dependent on that dimension. In our case, we want the iteration equation to execute only when the stop criteria hasn't been met, in other words, the iteration should be executed only while $|x_{n+1} - x_n| \\geq \\epsilon$. Using the __brk__ parameter, we can tell devito to break the iteration whenever that condition stops being met."
