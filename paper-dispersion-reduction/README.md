**Highlights:** In this directory we have added the codes of the Classical Finite Difference Schemes and the Finite Difference Schemes with Dispersion Reduction Property, in addition to the study that we are developing with Classical Schemes with Extra points.

**Important Informations:** These codes are part of the Project Software Technologies for Modeling and Inversion (STMI) at RCGI in the  University of Sao Paulo.

**Acknowledgements:** This research was carried out in association with the ongoing R&D project registered as ANP 20714-2 STMI - Software Technologies for Modelling and Inversion, with applications in seismic imaging (USP/Shell Brasil/ANP).

**Install Instructions:**

0) The Devito Package version that we used in our code is: 4.7.1+23
