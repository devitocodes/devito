def convert_multislice(multislice, shape, offsets, mode='get'):
    """
    Convert a multislice into a format suitable to YASK's get_elements_{...}
    and set_elements_{...} grid routines.

    A multislice is the typical object received by NumPy ndarray's __getitem__
    and __setitem__ methods; this function, therefore, converts NumPy indices
    into YASK indices.

    In particular, a multislice is either a single element or an iterable of
    elements. An element can be a slice object, an integer index, or a tuple
    of integer indices.

    In the general case in which ``multislice`` is an iterable, each element in
    the iterable corresponds to a dimension in ``shape``. In this case, an element
    can be either a slice or an integer index, but not a tuple of integers.

    If ``multislice`` is a single element,  then it is interpreted as follows: ::

        * slice object: the slice spans the whole shape;
        * single (integer) index: shape is one-dimensional, and the index
          represents a specific entry;
        * a tuple of (integer) indices: it must be ``len(multislice) == len(shape)``,
          and each entry in ``multislice`` corresponds to a specific entry in a
          dimension in ``shape``.

    The returned value is a 3-tuple ``(starts, ends, shapes)``, where ``starts,
    ends, shapes`` are lists of length ``len(shape)``. By taking ``starts[i]`` and
    `` ends[i]``, one gets the start and end points of the section of elements to
    be accessed along dimension ``i``; ``shapes[i]`` gives the size of the section.
