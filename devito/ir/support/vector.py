class Vector(tuple):

    """
    An object in an N-dimensional space.

    The elements of a vector can be anything as long as they support the
    comparison operators (`__eq__`, `__lt__`, ...). Also, the `__sub__`
    operator must be available.

    Notes
    -----
    1) Comparison of a Vector with a scalar
    If a comparison between a vector and a non-vector is attempted, then the
    non-vector is promoted to a vector; if this is not possible, an exception
    is raised. This is handy because it turns a vector-scalar comparison into
    a vector-vector comparison with the scalar broadcasted to as many vector
    entries as necessary. For example:

        (3, 4, 5) > 4 => (3, 4, 5) > (4, 4, 4) => False

    2) Comparison of Vectors whose elements are SymPy expressions
    We treat vectors of SymPy expressions as a very special case. When we
    compare two elements, it might not be possible to determine the truth value
    of the relation. For example, the truth value of `3*i < 4*j` cannot be
    determined (unless some information about `i` and `j` is available). In
    some cases, however, the comparison is feasible; for example, `i + 4 < i`
    is definitely False. A sufficient condition for two Vectors to be
    comparable is that their pair-wise indices are affine functions of the same
    variables, with identical coefficient.  If the Vector is instantiated
    passing the keyword argument ``smart = True``, some manipulation will be
    attempted to infer the truth value of a non-trivial symbolic relation. This
    increases the cost of the comparison (and not always an answer may be
    derived), so use it judiciously. By default, ``smart = False``.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If two Vectors cannot be compared, e.g. due to incomparable symbolic entries.

        The distance is a function [Vector x Vector --> D]. D is a tuple of length

        the i-th component of ``self``, self_i, precedes (< 0), equals (== 0), or
