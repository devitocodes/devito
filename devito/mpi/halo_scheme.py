    """
    A HaloScheme describes a set of halo exchanges through a mapper:

        ``M : Function -> HaloSchemeEntry``

    Where ``HaloSchemeEntry`` is a (named) 2-tuple:

        ``(loc_indices={}, halos=[(Dimension, DataSide), ...])``

    ``loc_indices`` is a dict telling how to access/insert the halo along non-halo
    indices. For example, consider the Function ``u(t, x, y)``. Assume ``x`` and
    ``y`` require a halo exchange. The question is: once the halo exchange is
    performed, at what offset in ``t`` should it be placed? should it be at ``u(0,
    ...)`` or ``u(1, ...)`` or even ``u(t-1, ...)``? ``loc_indices`` has as many
    entries as non-halo Dimensions, and each entry provides symbolic information
    about how to access the corresponding non-halo Dimension. For example, here
    ``loc_indices`` could be ``{t: t-1}``.

    ``halos`` is a list of 2-tuples ``(Dimension, DataSide)``. This is metadata
    about the halo exchanges, such as the Dimensions along which a halo exchange
    is expected to be performed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    exprs : expr-like or list of expr-like

        Logical decomposition of the DOMAIN region into OWNED and CORE sub-regions.

        This is "cumulative" over all DiscreteFunctions in the HaloScheme; it also
        takes into account IterationSpace offsets induced by SubDomains/SubDimensions.

        Examples
        --------
        Consider a HaloScheme comprising two one-dimensional Functions, ``u``
        and ``v``.  ``u``'s halo, on the LEFT and RIGHT DataSides respectively,
        is (2, 2), while ``v``'s is (4, 4). The situation is depicted below.

              ^^oo----------------oo^^     u
            ^^^^oooo------------oooo^^^^   v

        Where '^' represents a HALO point, 'o' a OWNED point, and '-' a CORE point.
        Together, the 'o' and '-' points constitute the DOMAIN region.

        In this example, the "cumulative" OWNED size is (left=4, right=4), that is
        the max on each DataSide across all Functions, namely ``u`` and ``v``.

        The ``omapper`` will contain the following entries:

            [(((d, CORE, CENTER),), {d: (d_m + 4, d_M - 4)}),
             (((d, OWNED, LEFT),), {d: (d_m, min(d_m + 3, d_M))}),
             (((d, OWNED, RIGHT),), {d: (max(d_M - 3, d_m), d_M)})]

        In presence of SubDomains (or, more generally, iteration over SubDimensions),
        the "true" DOMAIN is actually smaller. For example, consider again the
        example above, but now with a SubDomain that excludes the first ``nl``
        and the last ``nr`` DOMAIN points, where ``nl >= 0`` and ``nr >= 0``. Often,
        ``nl`` and ``nr`` are referred to as the "thickness" of the SubDimension (see
        also SubDimension.__doc__). For example, the situation could be as below

              ^^ooXXX----------XXXoo^^     u
            ^^^^ooooX----------Xoooo^^^^   v

        Where 'X' is a CORE point excluded by the computation due to the SubDomain.
        Here, the 'o' points are outside of the SubDomain, but in general they could
        also be inside. The ``omapper`` is constructed taking into account that
        SubDomains are iterated over with min point ``d_m + nl`` and max point
        ``d_M - nr``. Here, the ``omapper`` is:

            [(((d, CORE, CENTER),), {d: (d_m + 4, d_M - 4),
                                     nl: (max(nl - 4, 0),),
                                     nr: (max(nr - 4, 0),)}),
             (((d, OWNED, LEFT),), {d: (d_m, min(d_m + 3, d_M - nr)),
                                    nl: (nl,),
                                    nr: (0,)}),
             (((d, OWNED, RIGHT),), {d: (max(d_M - 3, d_m + nl), d_M),
                                     nl: (0,),
                                     nr: (nr,)})]

        To convince ourselves that this makes sense, we consider a number of cases.
        For now, we assume ``|d_M - d_m| > HALO``, that is the left-HALO and right-HALO
        regions do not overlap.

            1. The SubDomain thickness is 0, which is like there were no SubDomains.
               By instantiating the template above with ``nl = 0`` and ``nr = 0``,
               it is trivial to see that we fall back to the non-SubDomain case.

            2. The SubDomain thickness is as big as the HALO region size, that is
               ``nl = 4`` and ``nr = 4``. The ``omapper`` is such that no iterations
               will be performed in the OWNED regions (i.e., "everything is CORE").

            3. The SubDomain left-thickness is smaller than the left-HALO region size,
               while the SubDomain right-thickness is larger than the right-Halo region
               size. This means that some left-OWNED points are within the SubDomain,
               while the RIGHT-OWNED are outside. For example, take ``nl = 1`` and
               ``nr = 5``; the iteration regions will then be:

                - (CORE, CENTER): {d: (d_m + 4, d_M - 4), nl: (0,), nr: (1,)}, so
                  the min point is ``d_m + 4``, while the max point is ``d_M - 5``.

                - (OWNED, LEFT): {d: (d_m, d_m + 3), nl: (1,), nr: (0,)}, so the
                  min point is ``d_m + 1``, while the max point is ``dm + 3``.

                - (OWNED, RIGHT): {d: (d_M - 3, d_M), nl: (0,), nr: (5,)}, so the
                  min point is ``d_M - 3``, while the max point is ``d_M - 5``,
                  which implies zero iterations in this region.

        Let's now assume that the left-HALO and right-HALO regions overlap. For example,
        ``d_m = 0`` and ``d_M = 1`` (i.e., the DOMAIN only has two points), with the HALO
        size that is still (4, 4).

            4. Let's take ``nl = 1`` and ``nr = 0``. That is, only one point is in
               the SubDomain and should be updated. We again instantiate the iteration
               regions and obtain:

                - (CORE, CENTER): {d: (d_m + 4, d_M - 4), nl: (0,), nr: (0,)}, so
                  the min point is ``d_m + 4 = 4``, while the max point is
                  ``d_M - 4 = -3``, which implies zero iterations in this region.

                - (OWNED, LEFT): {d: (d_m, min(d_m + 3, d_M - nr)), nl: (1,), nr: (0,)},
                  so the min point is ``d_m + 1 = 1``, while the max point is
                  ``min(d_m + 3, d_M - nr) = min(3, 1) = 1``, which implies that there
                  is exactly one point in this region.

                - (OWNED, RIGHT): {d: (max(d_M - 3, d_m + nl), d_M), nl: (0,), nr: (0,)},
                  so the min point is ``max(d_M - 3, d_m + nl) = max(-2, 1) = 1``, while
                  the max point is ``d_M = 1``, which implies that there is exactly one
                  point in this region, and this point is redundantly computed as it's
                  logically the same as that in the (OWNED, LEFT) region.

        Notes
        -----
        For each Function, the '^' and 'o' are exactly the same on *all MPI
        ranks*, so the output of this method is guaranteed to be consistent
        across *all MPI ranks*.
