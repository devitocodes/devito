def cross_derivative(expr, dims, fd_order, deriv_order, x0=None, side=None, **kwargs):
    """
    Arbitrary-order cross derivative of a given expression.

    Parameters
    ----------
    expr : expr-like
        Expression for which the cross derivative is produced.
    dims : tuple of Dimension
        Dimensions w.r.t. which to differentiate.
    fd_order : int, optional, default=expr.space_order
        Coefficient discretization order. Note: this impacts the width of
        the resulting stencil.
    side : Side, optional, default=centered
        Side of the finite difference location, centered (at x), left (at x - 1)
        or right (at x +1).
    matvec : Transpose, optional, default=direct
        Forward (matvec=direct) or transpose (matvec=transpose) mode of the
        finite difference.
    x0 : dict, optional, default=None
        Origin of the finite-difference scheme as a map dim: origin_dim.
    coefficients : string, optional, default='taylor'
        Use taylor or custom coefficients (weights).
    expand : bool, optional, default=True
        If True, the derivative is fully expanded as a sum of products,
        otherwise an IndexSum is returned.

    Returns
    -------
    expr-like
        Cross-derivative of ``expr``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from devito import Function, Grid
    >>> grid = Grid(shape=(4, 4))
    >>> x, y = grid.dimensions
    >>> f = Function(name='f', grid=grid, space_order=2)
    >>> g = Function(name='g', grid=grid, space_order=2)
    >>> cross_derivative(f*g, dims=(x, y), fd_order=(2, 2), deriv_order=(1, 1))
    (-1/h_y)*(-f(x, y)*g(x, y)/h_x + f(x + h_x, y)*g(x + h_x, y)/h_x) + \
(-f(x, y + h_y)*g(x, y + h_y)/h_x + f(x + h_x, y + h_y)*g(x + h_x, y + h_y)/h_x)/h_y

    Semantically, this is equivalent to

    >>> (f*g).dxdy
    Derivative(Derivative(f(x, y)*g(x, y), x), y)

    The only difference is that in the latter case derivatives remain unevaluated.
    The expanded form is obtained via ``evaluate``

    >>> (f*g).dxdy.evaluate
    (-1/h_y)*(-f(x, y)*g(x, y)/h_x + f(x + h_x, y)*g(x + h_x, y)/h_x) + \
(-f(x, y + h_y)*g(x, y + h_y)/h_x + f(x + h_x, y + h_y)*g(x + h_x, y + h_y)/h_x)/h_y

    Finally the x0 argument allows to choose the origin of the finite-difference

    >>> cross_derivative(f*g, dims=(x, y), fd_order=(2, 2), deriv_order=(1, 1), \
    x0={x: x + x.spacing, y: y + y.spacing})
    (-1/h_y)*(-f(x + h_x, y + h_y)*g(x + h_x, y + h_y)/h_x + \
f(x + 2*h_x, y + h_y)*g(x + 2*h_x, y + h_y)/h_x) + \
(-f(x + h_x, y + 2*h_y)*g(x + h_x, y + 2*h_y)/h_x + \
f(x + 2*h_x, y + 2*h_y)*g(x + 2*h_x, y + 2*h_y)/h_x)/h_y
