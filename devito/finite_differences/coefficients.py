    ----------
    deriv_order : int
        The order of the derivative being taken.
    function : Function
        The function for which the supplied coefficients
        will be used.
    dimension : Dimension
        The dimension with respect to which the
        derivative is being taken.
    weights : np.ndarray

    -----
    If a Function is declared with 'symbolic' coefficients and no
    replacement rules for any derivative appearing in a Devito equation,
    the coefficients will revert to those of the 'default' Taylor
