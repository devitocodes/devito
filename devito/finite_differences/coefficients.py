class Coefficient(object):
    """
    Prepare custom coefficients to pass to a Substitutions object.

    Parameters
    ----------
    deriv_order : int
        The order of the derivative being taken.
    function : Function
        The function for which the supplied coefficients
        will be used.
    dimension : Dimension
        The dimension with respect to which the
        derivative is being taken.
    weights : np.ndarray
        The set of finite difference weights
        intended to be used in place of the standard
        weights (obtained from a Taylor expansion).

    Example
    -------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from devito import Grid, Function, Coefficient
    >>> grid = Grid(shape=(4, 4))
    >>> u = Function(name='u', grid=grid, space_order=2, coefficients='symbolic')
    >>> x, y = grid.dimensions

    Now define some partial d/dx FD coefficients of the Function u:

    >>> u_x_coeffs = Coefficient(1, u, x, np.array([-0.6, 0.1, 0.6]))

    And some partial d^2/dy^2 FD coefficients:

    >>> u_y2_coeffs = Coefficient(2, u, y, np.array([0.0, 0.0, 0.0]))

    >>> u = TimeFunction(name='u', grid=grid, space_order=2, coefficients='symbolic')

    Now create a Devito equation and pass to it 'subs'

    >>> from devito import Eq
    >>> eq = Eq(u.dt+u.dx, coefficients=subs)

    When evaluated, the derivatives will use the custom coefficients. We can
    check that by

    >>> eq.evaluate
    Eq(0.1*u(t, x, y) - 0.6*u(t, x - h_x, y) + 0.6*u(t, x + h_x, y) \

    Notes
    -----
    If a Function is declared with 'symbolic' coefficients and no
    replacement rules for any derivative appearing in a Devito equation,
    the coefficients will revert to those of the 'default' Taylor
    expansion.
